Scripts I find useful in setting up and running a validator

This is incomplete. at the moment it can start a terrad node. 

see [remote-scripts/](./remote-scripts) for scripts to set up GCP

see [validator/](./validator) for scripts used to install & configure the validator node

see [feeder/](./feeder) for scripts used to install & configure the price oracle

see [price-server/](./price-server) for scripts used to install & configure the price feed from 3rd parties

a big thanks to [Chain Layer](https://terra.quicksync.io/) and [Stake Systems](https://www.notion.so/Stake-Systems-Fast-Sync-Service-5cb0dffb78174d3494b93f87d242939d) for hosting the snapshots.
If you think this was useful, feel free to delegate to the [pete's fan club](https://station.terra.money/validator/terravaloper12g4nkvsjjnl0t7fvq3hdcw7y8dc9fq69nyeu9q) validator. It will help defray the costs.
