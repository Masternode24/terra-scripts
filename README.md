Scripts I find useful in setting up and running a validator

This is incomplete. at the moment it can start a terrad node. 

see [remote-scripts/](./remote-scripts) for scripts to set up GCP

see [validator/](./validator) for scripts used to install & configure the validator node

a big thanks to [Chain Layer](https://terra.quicksync.io/) for hosting the snapshots.

If you think this was useful, feel free to delegate to the [pete's fan club](https://terra.stake.id/#/validator/7463FFB4B492477E947B639620F1868E84A6FB84) validator. It will help defray the costs.
